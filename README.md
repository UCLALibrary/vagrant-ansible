Vagrant Ansible
The purpose of this repository is to help reproduce any environments built by Ansible within the Library. It involves gathering all of the Library contributed modules and setting up a base ansible root to mount the files in a local filesystem.

Execute buildroot.sh to create a baseroot and have your ansible server mount that folder.
